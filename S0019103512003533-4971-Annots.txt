Document S0019103512003533-4971:

Diurnally-averaged thermospheric temperatures, as calculated in simulation R15, are presented in Fig. 6 for the southern hemisphere (with those in the northern hemisphere being identical). We find daily variations of polar temperatures to be less than 6 K and thus virtually negligible, despite the strong diurnal variation of electron precipitation and thereby Joule heating (Fig. 3). The reasons for this are the long thermal time scales in Saturn’s upper atmosphere combined with the fast planetary rotation rate. This justifies discussing diurnally-averaged quantities hereafter.
