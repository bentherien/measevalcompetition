The North Sea Basin surrounding landmasses were within the northern rain belt (the southern boundary today is 40°N), which would have experienced elevated precipitation if the global hydrologic cycle became enhanced (Pagani et al., 2006b; Schmitz et al., 2001).

Considerably less Os input from the LIP (25%) is needed if the LIP basalts possess higher Os abundances (100 ppt) and if the Os contribution to seawater also occurred through the addition of gas known to be enriched 20 times that of the basalt (e.g., Yudovskya et al., 2008).

The advantage of that non-rotating mode is the time resolution of the instrument which is 16 times better than in the rotating mode (5.65 s) for the rate channels or 0.66 s for the priority channels instead of 86 s for a given pointing/pitch angle).
