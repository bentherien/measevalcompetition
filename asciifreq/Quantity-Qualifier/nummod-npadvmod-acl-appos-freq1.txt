While we might expect seedlings from larger seeded species like rowan (200,000 seeds weigh 1 kg) to have an advantage over seedlings from smaller seeded species such as birch (5.9 million seeds weigh 1 kg) in growing through brash (Leishman and Westoby, 1994) we found no significant difference between the proportion of rowan in windrows and interrows.
