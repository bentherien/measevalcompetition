Due to the insolubility of PTh, no accurate direct measurement of the molecular weight could be made (nor was this value indicated by the manufacturer), however a combination of different techniques in our previous work [37] suggested that the evaporated PTh is near its effective conjugation length (20–25 monomer units, Eg≈2.0 eV), which corresponds to Mw~1500–2000 g mol−1.
