The source and rate of released carbon are still under debate (Pagani et al., 2006a; Zeebe et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2011), but may have been linked to the dissociation of marine hydrates containing biogenic methane (δ13C of<−60‰) (Dickens et al., 1995), thermogenic methane from marine sediments around the Norwegian Sea (Svensen et al., 2004), or dissolved methane from a silled Kilda Basin between Greenland and Norway (Nisbet et al., 2009).

Above the onset of OAE 2, samples were taken from Pont d'Issole, whereas below the onset some of the samples (n=4) came from Vergons (Supplementary Material, Table 2d), which is correlated with Pont d'Issole based on litho-, bio-, and stable-isotope stratigraphy and is undisturbed by faulting in the pre-OAE 2 interval.

As already inferred from data of the first flybys of the Pioneer 11 (1979), Voyager 1 (1980) and Voyager 2 (1981) spacecraft, respectively (Smith et al., 1981; Krimigis et al., 1982), this moon plays the same role Io does for the jovian system.

Serial passaging of hiPSCs in static suspension in E8 medium. (a) Light microscope image of aggregates after 48 h post-inoculation of single suspension BC1 cells in ultra-low attachment plates. (b) BC1 cells cultured in E8 medium, expanded in static suspension culture for 13 passages (45 days, n = 3). (c) Flow cytometry plots (n = 3) of TRA-1–60 expression in hiPSCs after 13 passages in static suspension. (d) Light microscope image of HPC-like single suspending cells emerging around a spin-EB on day 14. (e) Flow cytometry plots (n = 2) of CD34 and CD45 expression in day-14 spin EBs.

Serial passaging of hiPSCs in static suspension in E8 medium. (a) Light microscope image of aggregates after 48 h post-inoculation of single suspension BC1 cells in ultra-low attachment plates. (b) BC1 cells cultured in E8 medium, expanded in static suspension culture for 13 passages (45 days, n = 3). (c) Flow cytometry plots (n = 3) of TRA-1–60 expression in hiPSCs after 13 passages in static suspension. (d) Light microscope image of HPC-like single suspending cells emerging around a spin-EB on day 14. (e) Flow cytometry plots (n = 2) of CD34 and CD45 expression in day-14 spin EBs.
