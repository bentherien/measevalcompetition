This flexibility included choosing from 2 systems, the “nutrient sufficiency recommendation system” which is developed to provide a 90–95% maximum yield for the year, and the “build maintenance fertility program” based soil test values over a planned period of time, usually 4–8 years, for both immediate crop needs and build up levels to a non-limiting value (Leikam et al., 2003).
