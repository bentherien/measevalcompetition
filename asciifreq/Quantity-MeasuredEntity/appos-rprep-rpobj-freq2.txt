The validity of the Framingham risk scores as measures of vascular risk was supported in our study, as they strongly predicted incidence of subsequent (manifest) vascular disease. Age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio for 10% increment in risk was 2.84 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66–4.88) for the stroke risk score-incident stroke association and 2.25 (95% CI 1.92–2.65) for the CHD risk score-incident CHD association.
