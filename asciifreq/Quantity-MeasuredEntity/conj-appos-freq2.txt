Considering the uncertainties (e.g. ±5% error in CO2 saturation) in the petrophysical experiments (Kummerow and Spangenberg, 2011; Ivanova et al., 2012) corresponding to ±70 m/s in Vp (Fig. 5), we did not take into account the Vp changes (Fig. 5, Eq. (1)) due to the different temperature scenarios (34 and 38 °C).

The two samples 2619.60 and 2614.71 have a spore and pollen palynological signature similar to samples from PA3/4 during the CIE (plot lower on axis 1) and are either not in the correct location (it cannot be discounted that these samples represent tectonically emplaced younger material (Payne et al., 2005), or were misplaced during drilling operations core handling), or represent very short episodes of both marine and terrestrial ecologic change to CIE-type conditions.
