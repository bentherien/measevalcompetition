Considerably less Os input from the LIP (25%) is needed if the LIP basalts possess higher Os abundances (100 ppt) and if the Os contribution to seawater also occurred through the addition of gas known to be enriched 20 times that of the basalt (e.g., Yudovskya et al., 2008).

However, basalts can have variable Os abundances (1 to 600 ppt; Martin, 1991; Crocket and Paul, 2008); typical values range from 1 to 30 ppt (e.g., Shirey and Walker, 1998; Allegre et al., 1999; Dale et al., 2008).
