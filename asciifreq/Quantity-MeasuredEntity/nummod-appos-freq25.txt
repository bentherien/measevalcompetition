For group analyses, the following procedures were applied. (1) T1-weighted sMRIs from each subject (Fig. 1A) were registered to MNI space (Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI-152 atlas as in Fig. 1B) using an affine transformation (FLIRT–FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool) (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001) in FSL (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/). (2) The cortical (Fig. 1C) and subcortical masks with pre-defined brain regions from the standard atlas were transferred to the individual's headspace (Fig. 1D), using the inverse of the transformation obtained in the first step: the Harvard-Oxford Atlas, part of the FSL software with masks of 96 cortical gray-matter regions (48 regions in each hemisphere), 21 sub-cortical regions, and cerebellum, was used. (3) The regional masks were down-sampled to a cubic source grid with voxels of 5 mm per side (Fig. 1E). (4) VESTAL MEG source imaging used the source grid from step 3.

Hydrogeological studies at the Ketzin site (Norden et al., 2010) have shown that a 2D radially symmetric model of the upper part (33 m) of the Stuttgart Formation can be used to interpret the 3D data acquired near the injection well (Fig. 7).

At thermospheric temperatures typically found on Saturn (320–500 K, Nagy et al., 2009), we do not expect H3+ cooling to play an important role, but we included the process to be able to assess its importance for cases where polar magnetospheric heating raises temperatures above ∼500 K. We implemented globally the H3+ cooling rates of Miller et al. (2010) in the form of a parameterisation as a function of local thermospheric temperature and H3+ density.

Two stock solutions of each standard compound were made; for AB, As(III), DMA and MMA the concentrations were 100 mg/L and 1 mg/L and for As(V) the concentrations were 10 mg/L and 0.1 mg/L. The stock solutions were prepared in nitric acid (1%), with the exception of As(III), in which concentrated hydrochloric acid was used to promote its dissolution.
