Above the onset of OAE 2, samples were taken from Pont d'Issole, whereas below the onset some of the samples (n=4) came from Vergons (Supplementary Material, Table 2d), which is correlated with Pont d'Issole based on litho-, bio-, and stable-isotope stratigraphy and is undisturbed by faulting in the pre-OAE 2 interval.
