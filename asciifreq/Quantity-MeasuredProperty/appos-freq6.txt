Rather, the δ30Si values of size fractions between 2 and 20 μm display a good correlation (r2=0.92, Fig. 2a) with surface silicic acid concentration and, where the water source δ30Si and silicic acid concentration are known or can be reasonably estimated, converge on an apparent 30ε of ∼–1‰ (Egan et al., 2012; Fripiat et al., 2011c).

Located within proximity to the North Atlantic igneous province (NAIP), the Kilda Basin, and the northern rain belt (paleolatitude 54 °N) during the PETM, this is a critical region for testing proposed triggers of atmospheric carbon release that may have caused the global negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in marine and terrestrial environments.
