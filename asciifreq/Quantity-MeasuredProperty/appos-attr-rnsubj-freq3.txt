The North Sea Basin surrounding landmasses were within the northern rain belt (the southern boundary today is 40°N), which would have experienced elevated precipitation if the global hydrologic cycle became enhanced (Pagani et al., 2006b; Schmitz et al., 2001).

The validity of the Framingham risk scores as measures of vascular risk was supported in our study, as they strongly predicted incidence of subsequent (manifest) vascular disease. Age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio for 10% increment in risk was 2.84 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66–4.88) for the stroke risk score-incident stroke association and 2.25 (95% CI 1.92–2.65) for the CHD risk score-incident CHD association.
