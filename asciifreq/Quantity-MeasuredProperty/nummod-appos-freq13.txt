However, basalts can have variable Os abundances (1 to 600 ppt; Martin, 1991; Crocket and Paul, 2008); typical values range from 1 to 30 ppt (e.g., Shirey and Walker, 1998; Allegre et al., 1999; Dale et al., 2008).

Considerably less Os input from the LIP (25%) is needed if the LIP basalts possess higher Os abundances (100 ppt) and if the Os contribution to seawater also occurred through the addition of gas known to be enriched 20 times that of the basalt (e.g., Yudovskya et al., 2008).

Considerably less Os input from the LIP (25%) is needed if the LIP basalts possess higher Os abundances (100 ppt) and if the Os contribution to seawater also occurred through the addition of gas known to be enriched 20 times that of the basalt (e.g., Yudovskya et al., 2008).

In the extreme case where faults are distributed uniformly and independently at random with a constant probability, say, 10%, of a node being faulty, node degrees of Δ∈O(clogn) would suffice to guarantee (at a given point in time) that the probability that more than Δ/9 neighbors of any node are faulty, is at most 1−1/nc.

The mass loss rate in our models is Ṁ>107kgs-1 and thus O is dragged along to high altitudes by H. On the other hand, collisions with H+ dominate the transport of heavy ions such as Si+ as long as the ratio [H+]/[H] ≳ 10−4 (Paper II).
